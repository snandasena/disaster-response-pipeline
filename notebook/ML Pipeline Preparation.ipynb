MADRID, March 18 (Reuters) - International humanitarian groups are finding pockets of suffering in northern Japan, but say most victims of the earthquake, tsunami, and snow blizzards are keeping warm and getting food, water and medical attention. In the context of providing assistance to people living in emergency evacuation areas and people rebuilding their homes, in addition to the role of the government, volunteers from the community will also have an extremely important part to play. * Due to deep inundation, equipment, switchboards, and electric sources were destroyed. When a cyclone hits people are forced to move out to community shelters or to relatives' homes, bringing with them only vital items such as blankets and food. The report analyses five situations affecting livelihoods: (1) high variations in cereal production; (2) deterioration in grazing conditions; (3) depressed production of cash crops; (4) market access and (5) food price changes.

The rains caused localized flooding in several eastern provinces and counties, in particular in the lower plains, near to the coast line. So you see there's lots of earthwork that needs doing . The additional financing for the Sindh On-Farm Water Management Project aims to improve the efficiency, reliability, and equity of irrigation water distribution at watercourse levels and enhance agricultural productivity. The floodwaters inundated two-thirds of Dhaka, a city of some 10 million people, and three-quarters of Bangladesh. This week's capsizing is the first incident reported in 2012. The floods began in late July in the northwest after exceptionally heavy monsoon rains, expanding rivers that have since swamped eastern Punjab province and Sindh province in the south. The rescue and relief operations initiated by the people themselve suffered serious setback on Saturday evening due to heavy thunderstorm. The floods followed unusually heavy rainfalls and caused major damages and destruction in parts of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, and Armenia. It says, ''The trends are considerably smaller than the negative trends in the north, and could be due to a combination of increased reservoir impoundment, mis-modelled naturally varying storage and (along the southeast coast) tectonic signals related to the Dec 26, 2004 Sumatran earthquake.''. The delay in the advance of monsoon over the northeast and its stagnation along the west coast after 8 June had been primarily due to the interference of high latitude circulation features with the monsoonal flow. Some HYCOS (Hydrological Cycle Observing Systems) stations are still working, but most of the time it is difficult to get the information when you need it, says Sitoe, explaining that the problem is compounded by flaky internet connections.\n",

      "Since 22 November 2008, there has been 719.4 mm of rainfall and cyclonic winds up to 80km/hr in the Jaffna Peninsula causing widespread flooding. Typhoon Parma, packing gusts of 230 kilometres (145 miles) an hour, was forecast to hit rural areas in the north of the Philippines' main island of Luzon before dawn on Saturday. Output was reduced as a result of a shortage of irrigation water following a mild winter and poor management of water resources, with catastrophic impacts on agriculture in the down river regions of the AmuDarya, the Autonomous Region of Karakalpakstan and Khorizem, but particularly the former. On April 18, a second eruption occurred, resulting in a volcanic mudflow, also referred to as a lahar. Therefore, we request all our supporters and friends to please consider donating for these emergency food relief aids for flood victims. **May 12** A 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck in the afternoon during our aid distribution and multiple strong aftershocks followed. The Swiss Ministry for Defence, Civil Protection and Sports is also preparing to send emergency power generators and medicine. The strongest wind force measured near the centre of Tropical Depression No. 8 was at Beaufort Scale 6 (39 to 49 kilometres per hour), with wind gusting to above Beaufort Scale 6. The main types of schemes developed by SCF are shallow wells, birkas, ponds and haffir dams (earthen dams). Relief experts on the scene say unusually heavy rains during the past two months have put up to 1.8 million children and family members at risk in parts of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia. Despite the favourable forecast for the summer (Kharif) cropping season in monsoon rains receiving areas, preliminary meteorological forecast indicates that availability of irrigation water will decline by 55 to 65 percent during the early part of Kharif season (April to June) and 16 to 26 percent in the latter part of the season (July to September) due to the cumulative effects of low rainfall seasons, including the main monsoon season. For a second time in less than a month, DPR Korea has been affected by floods triggered by torrential rainfalls produced by Typhoon Rusa. * Reduced mortality and morbidity among women, adolescents and children due to post-flood outbreak of communicable and infectious diseases. The Miyagi government said the series of major quakes had caused damage estimated at least 120 million yen (one million dollars) to the farming and fisheries industries in the area. However, there is normally a risk of late season pests such as quelea birds, sweet potato butterfly, stem-borers, African bollworm, stem rust, Welo bush cricket (affecting wheat, barley and teff), shoot-fly (affecting teff) and even locust at the end of the kiremt rains and before the main harvest. The Board approved assistance grants to five Muslim Communities in non member countries in India, USA, Malawi, Mauritius and Russia, in addition to educational grants to Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Somalia. Among the 19 provinces affected by the three weeks of storms, were the badly-hit southern Chinese provinces of Hunan and Guizhou, more famed for their chilli peppers and subtropical climate than for heavy snow. In the Broghal and Yarkhoon valleys of Chitral District (Northern Areas), some 4000 vulnerable persons are completely cut off and isolated as a result of continuous snowfall since December 2004. WHO recommends that the Government take immediate action to reduce the risk of dengue transmission and mitigate the impact of the dengue epidemic. Compared to 2003 when 60,000 people were affected, the 2004 floods has had less impact on the flood prone areas compared to previous years for several reasons; in Central Kenya, there was less rain on the Aberdare Mountains which usually overflows the dams and causes severe flooding downstream. Several small aftershocks have been registered since the quake, and information received indicate there might be further strong quakes because of the massive tectonic plate movements on 26 December. Due to rains floods and landslides have caused disruption to major road communication network in Lohit, Yingkiong, Changlang, Seppa, Anini, Roing & Along district. \"The findings attributed the poor harvest to unpredictable rainfall patterns as the rains which were less than normal and sparsely distributed started late and ended early,\" she noted. The worst flooding to hit the state in nearly 50 years followed catastrophic monsoon rains in northern and northeastern India, Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh that killed hundreds and left millions homeless. Most climate models also predict that India will be hit more and more by extreme rainfall events as the world continues to warm in the coming decades\", said the CSE.\n",

Officials said the floods -- triggered by unusually heavy monsoon season rains in Orissa and neighboring, upstream states -- had washed away 4,000 houses and damaged 18,000 homes in the same low-lying area that was savaged by a cyclone two years ago. The heaviest rainfalls, at 458 mm and 422 mm, were recorded in Quang Tri's My Chanh District and Thua Thien-Hue's A Luoi Town, respectively.

The severe drought parching east Africa has left 10 million facing hunger and the scope of one of the world's worst unfolding humanitarian disasters conjured up memories of Ethiopia's devastating 1984 famine. Seismologists agree that Padang will face more earthquakes in future, and warn that a much larger quake with far greater destructive force is inevitable in the region. The flash floods that followed torrential monsoonal rains in north-west Pakistan between 28 and 30 July have caused great loss of life and wide-spread damage to infrastructure, livestock and property in more than 100 villages. Lesotho and Swaziland would also experience scattered rains, he noted. But while floodwaters have subsided in some areas, there has been fresh flooding in the north of the state and more heavy rainfall forecast elsewhere. Approximately 1.9 million people have been affected in the past week by heavy torrential monsoon rains which flooded 195 blocks in 14 districts of the State of West Bengal. Separately, the West Java administration has said it plans to once more dredge the Citarum river to reduce the mass of sedimentation that contributes to the area's annual floods. With the help of the American Red Cross, Mr. Fernando and his family are using a compost bin to help remove from the streets household garbage that blocks drains and causes flooding. Continuing, he said the United Nations and its partners were also pursuing ways to promote water harvesting and implement modernized irrigation facilities so communities in the region were not totally dependent on rainwater to keep crops alive during dry spells. It may be mentioned here that long range forecasts of the Indian southwest monsoon rainfall are generated by many other national and global centres which employ different prediction techniques. The availability of feed from grain and crop residues has also fallen sharply due to the drop in agricultural production, especially in rainfed areas. Last year, hundreds of people died in several avalanches following record snowfalls. The northern and eastern parts of the country received less rain in the past northeastern monsoon and expect inter monsoonal showers these days. The initial assessments indicated that nearly 15,000 people had been affected - already double the estimates made on Tuesday - with over 8,000 left without shelter and two people dead. The southern African nation of Mozambique has once again been inundated by flood waters and hurricane force winds. Furthermore, the most recent cyclone to hit the country, tropical storm Manou, killed more than 70 people in May, severed roads and bridges and caused extensive damage to agricultural land. A blanket of acrid smog covered the sweltering capital itself, worsening the woes of Muscovites gasping in Russia's hottest weather since record-keeping began around 1880. Where localised flooding has forced the evacuation of whole communities, the authorities have moved residents to safer areas. This rapid-response shipment includes critically needed supplies to care for the thousands injured in Saturday's disaster: first-aid supplies, materials for making casts to set broken arms and legs, walkers, canes, crutches, warm weather clothing for hospital patients and hygiene kits. Further bad weather is predicted, with the government issuing a cyclone warning for Karachi and other coastal communities in the coming days. Two people were killed when a tree uprooted by the wind fell on them at a village in Chandpur district 170 km (106 miles) southeast of the capital Dhaka on Sunday. 4-7 February: Torrential rain coupled with seasonal rainfall leads to some of the worst flooding in Mozambique in more than half a century. The pledges made, in order of magnitude in terms of per annum commitments, included the following:. The cyclone and subsequent flooding in Baluchistan have killed 25 people, while 12 people were killed on Thursday in a separate deluge in the northwest of the country. More funds are needed to provide medicines, food and shelter. In the wake of the system temperatures are forecast to fall far below zero, with accompanying wind chill factor. By Himadri Ahsan, IFRC The monsoon depression over the northeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining Bangladesh coast intensified into a cyclonic storm named 'Komen' on Wednesday, 29 July, threatening to cause further downpours in regions that are already affected by the recent flash floods and deadly landslides.

Scattered rains and thundershowers were also expected on Tuesday. The formation of this depression and the consequent organisation of monsoon trough led to rapid advancement over the northern and northwestern parts of the country and covered the entire country by 30 June. Federation delegates who visited the scene of the disaster reported a huge crater at the centre of the blast, and said the nearest surviving buildings had been scorched as though a fireball had swept through them. Since records began in that part of the world in 1877, Sidr obtained the title of the second strongest cyclone to make landfall in Bangladesh,\" Rob Gutro and Ed Olsen, weather analysts with the US-based Goddard Space Flight Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said on the NASA website.\n",
